# 🔍 Crime Analysis Project 🚔

## 🎯 Objective

This project involves analyzing crime data from the `crimes.csv` dataset as part of a DataCamp project. The primary goal is to extract insights from the dataset and answer key questions related to crime trends and patterns. 

### Who Will Benefit? 🤔
- **Law Enforcement Agencies** 👮‍♂️: Helps in resource allocation and crime prevention strategies.
- **Policymakers** 🏛️: Supports the development of informed policies to enhance public safety.
- **Researchers & Data Analysts** 📊: Provides valuable insights into crime patterns for further study.

## ❓ Key Questions Addressed

1. **Peak Crime Hour ⏰**: Identified the hour with the highest frequency of crimes.
2. **Peak Night Crime Location 🌙**: Determined the area with the highest crime rate during nighttime (10 PM - 3:59 AM).
3. **Victim Age Group Analysis 👥**: Categorized and counted the number of crimes committed against different age groups.

## 📈 Data Analysis & Visualization

To better understand crime trends, various visualizations were used:
