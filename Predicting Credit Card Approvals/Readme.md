# Credit Card Approval using Supervised Learning

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict credit card approvals. By using supervised learning techniques and optimizing hyperparameters, we aim to improve the model's performance and achieve high accuracy.

## Model Optimization
To enhance model performance, **GridSearchCV** was used to fine-tune hyperparameters, improving the initial accuracy from **0.74** to **0.76**.

## Results
- The best model achieved an accuracy of **0.76** after hyperparameter tuning.
- The model can predict credit card approvals with high confidence, helping banks automate decision-making efficiently.
